# Arduino Operation Game

When I was a boy, I had an old "Operation" game (here, in Italy, was called "L'allegro chirurgo"). It, basically, was just composed by a simple circuit based on two C sized batteries, a little incandescent bulb (for the nose), and an electromechanic buzzer.

After 35 years the game was still in perfect conditions, so in a day of december, I decided to take it out of the box to amuse my daughters. But it was in 2018: almost nobody uses C sized battery, nowadays, the mechanical buzzer was failing, and the incandescent lamp seemed like found in a museum. So, I thought "no problem, let's modernize it!"

So I built a simple arduino circuit with a little speaker (taken from an old cordless phone) and a red led, and wrote a simple sketch that plays a wav sample and blinks the led when contact between the tweezers and the metal plate is detected.

In this repository you can find the arduino code, some photos of the build, and 3d models of the enclosure and the red nose (quickly sketched on tinkercad).
